#### Introduction

> Since I got into the IT industry in 2016, I became more and more interested in artificial intelligence. It is like an ultimate goal for people who work in computer field and now it finally becomes realistic to be doable during recent years. In order to be better on working and studying in AI, I decide to applied to the CS graduated school to train myself to become more professional in CS (since my undergraduate background is not in CS) as well as looking for more opportunity to do research in AI.
<br>
This post is purely about personal brain storming about how to make AI to think as human. I had been paying attention to the news about AI industry since I had got intested. I noticed that most of the reseraching results are about the "sensations". For example, picure recognation, voice recognation, language processing and so on, are all about AI's sensations. I am actually more interested in how can AI think as real person? This idea can be too early to be discussed, since it may involved with other scientific research in bio, math and so on. However, I would like to just make some bold hypothesis here as a blog post.
<br>
<br>
First of all, why we need a human-like AI? I mean, our technology will eventually be able to build the best computer in the world ever, that can calculate almost everything. However, it will be just like in the humor sence in the movie, "I see you are crying, base on my calculation, I think you will need a tissue...". Well, it does solve the problem, "tear -> need tissue to wipe". But I think we may need something more, something deeper, like "Oh, I know you just broke up with your boyfriend, and I know the feeling, although I never have a boyfriend or girlfriend..." or "Oh, I know you are crying because you are about to get married, let's open a champgin to celebrate!!!", something like these. I think the ultimate form of AI should eventually be a intelligence that can truelly get human's feeling because it actually share the same way of thinking instead of just throw options base on data-calculations.
<br>
<br>
Again, I am totally a novice in this field, but since I had frenquenly came up with these CRAZY ideas, it will never hurt to write them down. At the end of the day, HYPOTHESIS will always help you think.

#### Guess #ONE
> To make this happen, I believe AI needs to be given a core feature, which I haven't decided yet. I have several candidates, [satisfication], [greed], or [selfishness]. Among them, I think satisfication is the closest one (but I may correct myself in the future). Everything human is doing always leads to the reason of chasing self-satisfication. No matter what unselfish thing a person is doing, it can always be traced back to the reason of satisfication. 

> Our society is different from anynimal's society because we have ethical standard, which is build for the reason of harmony. The good thing or bad thing that we defined, is for the purpose of maintain social harmony which can lead to better survial situation. To better explain this, I will use a diagram, because it can be complicated to describe in words.

[[[[[ Insert Satisfication & Social diagram]]]]]


> Thus, to be more "human-like", a AI should have the similar purpose or goal, which drive it to learn, not because it wants to learn, but simply because it has to learn to get closer to it's goal which it can never reach.




> Can we build a 100% brain-like system purely by "codes" or it must be a bio-related system? Currently, all the AI approaches are depended on mathmetical and statistical fundations to simulate the way of human learning progress, which will allow machine be more like a human. I am thinking about, whether it is possible to make this learning progress more naturally? I mean, I believe that human beings were orginally a simple cell at the very beginning of our evolution history. Although, this is still debatable, but it's pretty sure that we definitely evolved from some SIMPLE form of creatures.
<br>
<br>
We all know that our brain is very powerful and complicated developed. However, it must not be this well developed million years ago. It was refined from generation to generation, from simple to complicated, from several CORE BLOCKS to TONS of CORE BLOCKS. Here comes my hypothesis, assume our simplist form of cave-AI's mind only consist of select core nero blocks, which I am not sure what they should exactly be now. But [Selfishness] is definitely a must-have core block (I always believe Selfishness is useful to us and I am also interested about kunikos idea, maybe will get a post to discuss my opinion about it). 
<br>
<br>
Thus, instead of having complicated mathmetical and statistical application for the learing simulation, we will build our core block with carefully designed algorithm. Then, the core blocks will be used to developed in it's path, and refined (or add more) core blocks, which lead to a evolution.

#### What will lead to consciousness?
> I am very interested in this topic, and in fact, if I ever get a chance, it will be my final study object for the rest of my life. In the previous section, I mentioned about __Selfishness__ is important for human evolution (my personal idea, disclaimer). I think the only thing, or at least one of the core factors that will lead to consciousness of machine, is __Selfishness__. Let me express my idea in 2 points.
<br>
<br>
First of all, human nature is ALL about Selfishness. Before I get "BOO" from people, let me explain. There are two ancient Chinese philosophers who holded 2 completely opposited ideas. Mencius said, human nature is GOOD, and Xun Kuang said, human nature is BAD. I stand for the latter. Human is no more than just an animal, no matter how smart we are. As long as we are limited by the flesh body (if we eventually can have machine body or cyber body, it will be different), we will be subjected to selfishness. It is designed by genes to fullfill our purpose in this world, TO EXPAND OUR DNAs. Every single thing that we do is for that purpose, and selfishness will guarantee or at least allow us to have the highest chance to achieve this goal.
<br>
<br>
Second, what I just said about human nature is ALL about selfishness, may make me a cynic. However, that is true before human beings had civilizations. __Morals__ is my second gist. It is the key to distinguish us from regular animals. Here I will throw out some bullet points for you to think about by yourselt:
<br>
<br>
1. Why animals can never evolved as powerful as human beings?
<br>
A: I don't know if this is true, but I think it makes perfect sense. Due to body advantages (fingers etc.), human realize working together will increase surviving chances, which further lead to EXPTEND DNAs. Thus, human learn to stay together, work together, and protect each other. This is the proto-type of society. However, as human beings are driven by Selfishness just as other normal animals, we will have conflicts which will is bad to our society. Thus, in order to maintain this society, we made __Morals__ as cannon for our behaviors. For example, cheating your partner is classificated as morally bad since it will lead to social disorders, but animals did this all the time and it is very common in their societies. Also, treating people with politeness is classificated as morally good since it makes others feel better, which stablizes the social stableness.
<br>
2. Since human beings has __Morals__ to be different from animals, "All human nature is Selfishness" still valid?
A: It is still valid. Let me use the two examples, cheating & politeness to explain my arguements. Our nature is designed to expand our DNSs, which means cheating is a very good way to do achieve this goal. However, since we need be loyal to our partner for social stableness (morals), we will struggle about cheating or being loyal. Here is the divergence, but all lead to the same reason, selfishness. If you choose to cheating, it means cheating makes you happier than being loyal (you may will regret about that, but the regretness is also due to selfishness, worried about losing). If you choose to be loyal since you love your partner so much, let's face it, you will not risk anything that will make you lose your favorite partner (still selfishness). Or if you don't love your partner any more, however you still choose to be loyal, it just mean being loyal fullfill your moral standard that make your feel not guilty (you actually just try to make yourself feel better).

...

<br>
<br>
All these ideas about selfishness is not trying to convince people that I am a cynic. My point is we should face the fact, that selfishness is very important for AI to develop its own moral, which hopefully lead to a consciousness.
