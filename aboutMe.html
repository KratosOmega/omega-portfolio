                    Hello World! My name is Xin Li and I am a software engineer with M.S. computer science degree. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My interest in software development started back in 2016 when I first started working with software developers. Ever since then, I improved my skills by attending bootcamp and M.S. program in university.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Fast-forward to today, I had accumulated experience of working as a full stack software engineer, as well as research experience in university AI-related projects.
                </p>
