          Hello, my name is Xin Li and I am a junior Java Web Application Developer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from University of Maryland, College Park as a B.S. double major degree in Information Systems and Accounting. And after that, I had accomplished and earned 800+ hours practical coding experience within 12 weeks in coding bootcamp. Now I am completely ready for becoming a professional software developer. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Currently, although I am a junior developer, but I am a very fast learner and big fan on new technologies. I also have strong self-studying ability and passion to keep pushing myself to learn new things. I am also good at problem solving and I love accepting challenges.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          One MUST-KNOW thing about me is my talent on programming. Although neither of my college majors are Computer Science, but for the only 2 coding classes that i had completed in UMCP, I was always the top student in the class and passes the course with A+. Like others, I took a period of time to realized what my real strength is and what I really enjoying doing everyday.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So here I am, a junior java developer who will never stop learning and never get enough about new technologies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am looking forward to meeting more talented people, so that I can join and learn from them.
